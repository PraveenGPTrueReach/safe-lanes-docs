# SafeLanes Rest Hours Submodule -- Business Requirements & Technical SOW

Below is a **Business-Oriented SOW** that blends **functional requirements** (i.e., what the submodule needs to do from a business perspective) with **critical technical details** (i.e., how it will be designed and integrated). This document can serve as a **business requirements** reference for stakeholders, while still containing enough detail for the development team to proceed confidently.

## 1. Introduction

SafeLanes aims to enhance its existing maritime ERP ("Sail App") with a dedicated **Rest Hours Submodule**. The goal is to **ensure regulatory compliance** (e.g., MLC, STCW, OPA) by accurately tracking crew work/rest hours, identifying non-conformities (NCs), and providing analytics.

**Key Business Drivers:**

- Consolidate rest-hour data in a single system for **both vessel and office** users.
- Automate detection of **violations** to reduce compliance risk.
- Facilitate **planning** (fixed/variable tasks) and post-hoc analysis via **dashboards**.

To achieve these objectives, the submodule will be delivered as a **standalone microservice** that seamlessly integrates with the existing Sail App via **Module Federation** (frontend) and **PM2 + Nginx** (backend).

## 2. Scope & Functional Requirements

1. **Core Recording**
    - **Daily Work/Rest Hours**: Each crew member inputs hour-by-hour rest/work status (including partial hours if needed).
    - **Validation**: Automated check for missing or overlapping entries.
    - **Overriding Planned Hours**: If actual conditions differ from planned schedules, updates must be allowed.
2. **Planning & Scheduling**
    - **Fixed Tasks**: Recurrent tasks or watch schedules (e.g., 4-on/8-off patterns).
    - **Variable Tasks**: Ad hoc tasks (port calls, drills) with start/finish times.
3. **Compliance & Violations**
    - **Immediate Violation Detection**: Trigger industry-standard codes (e.g., "MLC violation code 1--8").
    - **NC Logging**: If repeated or serious violations occur, mark them as non-conformities.
4. **Dashboards & Analytics**
    - **Vessel-Level**: Summaries of incomplete data, daily or weekly violation rates.
    - **Office-Level**: Fleet-wide compliance metrics, trending analyses, predicted future violations, rank/department breakdowns.
    - **Historical Reporting**: Yearly, quarterly, monthly violation patterns, plus drill-down to specific vessels.
5. **User Roles & Permissions**
    - **Vessel**: Vessel User (crew), Vessel Admin (senior officer), Vessel Super Admin (Master).
    - **Office**: Office User (superintendents), Office Admin (managers), Office Super Admin (top-level).
    - **External**: Possibly read-only for auditors.
    - Access is enforced via **JWT** tokens and existing SafeLanes RBAC.

## 3. Business Needs & Outcomes

1. **Regulatory Compliance**: Reduces risk of fines or detentions by automatically detecting rest-hour violations.
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined daily data entry and fewer manual checks on vessel/office side.
3. **Actionable Insights**: Dashboards help management pinpoint frequent NCs or departments prone to overwork.
4. **Better Planning**: Align actual recorded hours with watch schedules or unique tasks.

## 4. High-Level Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Microservice Delivery

- **Frontend**:
  - **Angular** microfrontend (remote) with **Module Federation**.
  - SafeLanes (the "host" application) references the rest-hour remote in webpack.config.js (ModuleFederationPlugin).
  - The microfrontend reuses shared dependencies (e.g., AuthService, UI libraries) from the host.
- **Backend**:
  - **Nest.js** microservice (resthour_service.js) managing REST endpoints for recording, planning, and compliance checks.
  - **PM2** used to run the process (e.g., pm2 start resthour_service.js --name resthour_service), with **Nginx** reverse proxy (location /resthour/ { ... }).
- **Database**:
  - **MySQL** schema, with new tables for rest-hour logs, violations, tasks, etc.
  - **Migration Scripts** (SQL or Knex) provided by the vendor, deployed by SafeLanes.
  - **Soft Delete & "updatedAt"** fields to handle concurrency with an offline--online sync strategy ("last-write-wins").

### 4.2 Deployment & Environment

- **Online Servers**: 16GB RAM, 4 cores.
- **Offline Ship Environments**: 8GB RAM, 2+ cores.
- **Sync**: Vessel DB sync with central DB daily or on-demand, using updatedAt to resolve conflicts.

**4.3 Connectivity & Synchronization**

- Vessel-side data syncs periodically every day as well as on-demand sync button that syncs with the master server, ensuring updates flow both ways.
- Offline access on vessel side with local DB.
- socket.io is used for on-demand sync of data

## 5. Detailed Business Workflows

1. **Vessel User**
    - Logs daily rest/work hours (Screen 2c).
    - Views personal schedule.
    - Overwrites planned tasks if reality differs.
2. **Vessel Admin**
    - Creates/edit watch schedules (3a) or variable tasks (3b).
    - Oversees subordinate crew's rest-hour entries, acknowledges violations.
3. **Vessel Super Admin** (Master)
    - Full control over planning & recording.
    - Can lock monthly records or sign off.
    - Escalates repeated NCs to office if needed.
4. **Office Admin**
    - Monitors compliance across a group of vessels (Screens O2.0a, O2.0b, O2.0c).
    - Investigates trends or repeated NCs.
    - May correct errors in the vessel data (per client policy).
5. **Office Super Admin**
    - Fleet-wide view of all vessels.
    - High-level analytics, overall system config (e.g., user roles, advanced reports).

## 6. Deliverables & Responsibilities

### 6.1 Core deliverables

1. **Frontend Microfrontend (Angular)**
    - Complete codebase for rest-hour remote module.
    - Module Federation config details: exposed components, routing structure.
2. **Backend Service** (resthour_service.js)
    - Nest.js code with required REST endpoints.
    - Integration with existing JWT auth.
    - Clear documentation on environment variables/config.
3. **Database Migration Scripts**
    - Schema creation or updates for rest-hour tables, including indexes, relationships, and "soft-delete" fields.
    - Provided in a format suitable for SafeLanes to apply to each client DB.
4. **Integration & Menu Guidance**
    - Guidance on adding new routes, nav items, or menu links to the monolithic Sail App.
    - Collaboration on final Module Federation plugin config.
5. **Documentation & Basic Support**
    - Brief deployment instructions for testing (dev/staging) and production.
    - Quick reference for SafeLanes admins on how to run or stop resthour_service.js with PM2.

### 6.2 The base app already has:

1. **Host Application**
    - webpack.config.js for module federation.
2. **Server Setup & Deployment**
    - Configured **Nginx** location blocks for /resthour/.
    - Deployed and started the resthour_service.js using **PM2** across online/offline environments.
    - Provide all environment variables, e.g., DB credentials, JWT secrets.
3. **Database Environment**
    - Supplied base dump (e.g., &lt;clientId&gt;\_resthour_db) to build upon.
    - Ran the vendor-supplied migration scripts for each environment (production, staging, offline ships, etc.).

## 7. Key Assumptions & Constraints

1. **JWT Auth**: The existing SafeLanes authentication scheme remains consistent---no rework needed.
2. **Offline Environments**: The submodule must function on limited connectivity ships, with local DB usage and a scheduled or on-demand sync approach.
3. **Performance**: The hardware specs (8GB/2+ cores offline, 16GB/4 cores online) are deemed sufficient for the additional Rest Hours microservice.
4. **No Docker**: Deployment uses PM2 (and not containerization), given the offline environment's limitations.
