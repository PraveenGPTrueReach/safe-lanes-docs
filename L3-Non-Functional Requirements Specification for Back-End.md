## L3-NFRS-BE: Non-Functional Requirements Specification (NFRS) for BE

### 1. Introduction
This document specifies the non-functional requirements for the Back-End (BE) component––the Nest.js + MySQL service supporting SafeLanes’ Rest Hours solution. It outlines performance, security, usability, reliability, compliance, and environmental constraints pertinent to the Back-End at both the vessel (offline) and office (online) sites. The scope of these requirements focuses on current usage levels (up to ~30 concurrent vessel users, ~100 office users) and moderate data transaction rates, aligning with the clarifications provided by the client.

### 2. Dependencies and Requirements
This BE component inherits and builds on the following high-level documents and clarifications:

- L1-NFRS: High-level Non-Functional Requirements.  
- L1-HLD: High-Level Design, describing overall architecture (vessel/offline + office/online).  
- L1-KD: Key Technical Decisions, e.g., single-record-per-day schema, conflict resolution approach.  
- L3-FRS-BE: Functional Requirements Specification for the Back-End (details REST endpoints, data model).  
- L3-KD-BE: Key Technical Decisions for the Back-End at component level (e.g., offline session keys, UTC offset handling).  
- L3-WF-BE: Workflow Details for how the BE handles authentication, data submission, conflict resolution, and synchronization.  
- Client Clarifications #1–#13: Guidance on scaling, encryption, backup retention, concurrency, offline session keys, auditing measures, etc.  

These dependencies shape the non-functional criteria below.

### 3. Performance Requirements
The Back-End must handle typical CRUD operations for daily rest-hour logs, tasks, and synchronization with acceptable response times under moderate concurrency.

#### 3.1 Response Times
- Under normal load (~30 vessel users, ~100 office users), 95% of standard CRUD requests (create/update rest-hour records, tasks) should complete within 2 seconds.  
- More complex or aggregated endpoints (dashboards, simple analytics) should generally respond within 4 seconds for 95% of requests.  
- If vessels have been offline for multiple weeks, synchronization operations may take proportionally longer (e.g., up to 30–60 min for large backlogs at ~256–512 kbps satellite speeds).  

#### 3.2 Throughput & Concurrency
- Typical concurrency remains modest (dozens of concurrent sessions at the office, up to 30 crew members on each vessel).  
- The Back-End is expected to handle short data bursts (sync sessions) gracefully without exhausting server resources.

#### 3.3 Load & Stress Testing
- Per Clarification #1, performance testing will be primarily manual on a staging environment with nominal concurrency.  
- The system should at least demonstrate that it meets the stated response-time metrics under typical usage scenarios (30–100 concurrent users).  
- The development team may, at its discretion, use lightweight tools (e.g., JMeter) for spot testing, but full automated stress-tests in CI/CD are not mandatory.

#### 3.4 Scalability Approach
- Per Clarification #2, the office Back-End will rely on manual scaling (hardware upgrades—CPU/RAM) if usage exceeds ~100 concurrent office users or consistently high resource usage is detected (80%+ for an extended period).  
- The vessel Back-End does not require auto-scaling—8 GB RAM, 2 CPU cores are typically sufficient. Basic OS-level monitoring is advised.

### 4. Security Requirements
Security in this context addresses both online (office) and offline (vessel) modes, ensuring role-based access, data protection, and minimal risk of unauthorized overwrites.

#### 4.1 Authentication & Authorization
- The Back-End validates tokens via SafeLanes Identity Service (JWT) when online.  
- Vessels store short-lived offline session keys valid for up to 14 days. If offline >14 days, local Master/Admin override is allowed (per Clarification #9).  
- External or read-only users must be strictly prevented from modifying any data. The Back-End rejects unauthorized write attempts with 403 Forbidden.

#### 4.2 Data & Offline Key Protection
- Data in transit (office-vessel, user-server) must employ TLS 1.2 or higher.  
- Encryption at rest is optional but recommended (per Clarification #3). OS-level disk encryption (BitLocker, LUKS) is acceptable if clients wish to enable it.  
- Offline session keys remain in plaintext in the local vessel DB, protected by OS-level file permissions and optional full-disk encryption.

#### 4.3 Audit Logging Integrity
All overwrites for compliance-critical data (rest-hour logs), as well as any other fields, are recorded in an immutable audit log. At the current scale (up to ~30 vessel users, ~100 office users), explicit tamper-evident mechanisms (e.g., cryptographic hashing) are not mandated. Existing database ACLs are deemed sufficient to restrict direct edits. However, future regulatory or business requirements may warrant a more robust, cryptographically verifiable audit trail.

### 5. Usability Requirements
While the Back-End primarily exposes RESTful APIs rather than a user interface, there remain relevant usability considerations:

#### 5.1 API Documentation & Consistency
- REST endpoints must be documented clearly (e.g., via OpenAPI or internal references) to ensure predictable usage by vessel and office front-ends.  
- Error responses should maintain consistent HTTP status codes and JSON structures.

#### 5.2 Minimal Learning Curve for Admin Operators
- Vessel or office system administrators must be able to configure the BE easily (e.g., environment variables, property files).  
- Documentation on manual scaling, backup/restore, and log auditing must be concise and accessible.

### 6. Reliability Requirements
Reliability covers uptime, backup, and failure handling. Vessels operate offline by design, so reliability focuses on stable local usage and safe re-synchronization.

#### 6.1 Uptime Targets
- Office Back-End targets ~99.5% monthly availability (per L1-NFRS). Vessel servers are “best effort,” with manual restarts if needed.  
- Single instance architecture at the office (per Clarification #10). Accept a few hours downtime in case of hardware failure, with data restored from daily backups.

#### 6.2 Backup & Recovery
- Daily database snapshots at vessel and office levels (plaintext backups are acceptable per Clarification #7).  
- Retention is indefinite (L1-NFRS compliance). Restoration from backups may require manual merges of unsynced local data if a vessel DB is corrupted.  
- In the office environment, manual recovery (RTO up to 8 hours, RPO up to 24 hours) is allowed.

#### 6.3 Conflict Resolution
All data, including compliance-critical fields, follows a last-write-wins approach with no additional admin-driven merges or approvals. Overwritten records remain in the audit log as a historical record of changes, acknowledging that “silent overwrites” may occur.

### 7. Compliance Requirements
The BE must adhere to maritime regulations (MLC, STCW, OPA if enabled) and store data indefinitely for potential audits or inspections.

#### 7.1 Regulatory Alignment
- Retain all rest-hour data for indefinite periods, supporting potential legal or port-state inquiries.  
- Enforcement of roles, read-only external audits, and archived logs meet minimal maritime compliance standards (per L1-NFRS, L1-FRS).

#### 7.2 Data Privacy
- Per Clarification #13, no additional data-privacy or GDPR obligations are enforced unless the client explicitly requests them. All personal data remains in identifiable form for regulatory traceability.

### 8. Environmental Requirements

#### 8.1 Hardware & Software
- Office Server: ~16 GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, running Nest.js + MySQL (with PM2, Nginx). Manual scaling only if usage consistently remains near resource limits.  
- Vessel Server: ~8 GB RAM, 2 CPU cores. Linux or Windows OS, hosting Nest.js + MySQL, packaged with minimal overhead. Basic OS-level monitoring (per Clarification #6).

#### 8.2 Network Environment
- All data sync is initiated outbound from the vessel to the office over a secured (TLS) channel.  
- Typical satellite bandwidth: 256–512 kbps. Daily or on-demand sync typically takes 5–10 minutes for a day’s data. If offline for weeks, sync time can significantly increase (per Clarification #8).

#### 8.3 Attachments & Storage
- Attachments (≤5 MB) are stored indefinitely on the main server file system (per Clarification #11). Disk expansion or housekeeping is performed manually as usage grows.

All non-functional aspects here align with L1/L2 materials, L3-FRS-BE, L3-KD-BE, L3-WF-BE, and the client clarifications.
